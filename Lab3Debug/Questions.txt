3 (a) I. Boolean. False

II. Double. 37.8

III. Int. 268

IIII. Int. 624


(b) I. output is:
				9.78
				9
				9
				99.78
				99

	real output:
				9.78
				9
				9
				99.78
				18.78

Read the last print statement wrong should be 18.78. I thought it was newStr + newNum

II. output:
				007

	real output:
				007


III. output:
				Bee ByeBye

	real output:
				Error exception

You get an error becuase String.replace() should be s.replace()

C. 
Strings are objects and not primitive data types, and cannot be changed.
Alternatives would be StringBuilder or StringBuffer.
